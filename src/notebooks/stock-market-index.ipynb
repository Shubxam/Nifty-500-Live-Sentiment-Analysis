    "\n",
    "#### Impact Cost\n",
    "- Impact cost represents the cost of executing a transaction in a given stock, for a specific predefined order size, at any given point of time.\n",
    "- It is different than the price at which the stock is traded.\n",
    "- Impact cost is a function of the order size and the liquidity of the stock.\n",
    "- Impact cost is a practical and realistic measure of market liquidity; it is closer to the true cost of execution faced by a trader in comparison to the bid-ask spread.\n",
    "- It is the difference between the expected price (ideal price) of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed.\n",
    "- Impact cost may vary for different transaction sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider the following order book for a stock:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Bid Price | Buy Quantity | Sell Quantity | Ask Price |\n",
    "|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----------|\n",
    "| 99        | 1000         | 500           | 102       |\n",
    "| 98        | 2000         | 2000          | 104       |\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a trader wants to buy 1500 stocks, then based on the bid-ask spread, the expected price for a stock would be 100.5 rs.\n",
    "- But given the liquidity of the stock, and his order size, the actual price at which the trade is executed may be different.\n",
    "- For his buy order of 1500 stocks, the impact cost would be the difference between the expected price and the actual price at which the trade is executed.\n",
    "- Trader buys 500 stocks at 102 rs, and 1000 stocks at 104 rs. Hence, his actual price per share comes out to be (500 * 102 + 1000 * 104) / 1500 = 103.33 rs.\n",
    "- Hence, the impact cost = (103.33 - 100.5)/100.5 = 2.8%.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Suppose a stock trades at bid 99 and ask 101. We say the \"ideal\" price is ₹ 100. Now, suppose a buy order for 1000 shares goes through at ₹ 102. Then we say the market impact cost at 1000 shares is 2%. If a buy order for 2000 shares goes through at ₹ 104, we say the market impact cost at 2000 shares is 4%. Market impact cost is the best measure of the liquidity of a stock. It accurately reflects the costs faced when actually trading an index. For a stock to qualify for possible inclusion into the NIFTY 50, it has to reliably have market impact cost of below 0.50 % when doing NIFTY 50 trades of two crore rupees.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Price Index\n",
    "\n",
    "- NIFTY family of indices are price index and hence reflects the returns one would earn if investment is made in the index portfolio. \n",
    "- Only capital gains arising due to price movements of constituent stocks are indicated in a price index.\n",
    "- However, a price index does not consider the returns arising from dividend receipts. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total Return Index\n",
    "\n",
    "- To get a true picture of returns, the dividends received from the constituent stocks also need to be factored in the index values. Such an index, which includes the dividends received, is called the Total Returns Index. \n",
    "- Total Returns Index reflects the returns on the index arising from:\n",
    "    1. Constituent stock price movements.\n",
    "    2. Dividend receipts from constituent index stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsystematic risk\n",
    "- Risk that is unique to a particular company or industry. \n",
    "- It is also known as diversifiable risk or specific risk.\n",
    "- It can be reduced through diversification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Systematic risk\n",
    "- Risk that affects the entire market. \n",
    "- It is also known as non-diversifiable risk or market risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Beta\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Systematic risk of various securities differ because of their relationship with the market. \n",
    "- How systematic risk affects an index/portfolio compared to the market as whole is measured by the beta of the index/portfolio.\n",
    "- The Beta factor describes the movement in a stock's or a portfolio's returns in relation to that of the market returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beta is calculated as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\beta = \\frac{Cov (R_i, R_m)}{Var (R_m)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $(R_i)$ = return of the stock or portfolio\n",
    "- $(R_m)$ = return of the market (broader market index, e.g., Nifty 50)\n",
    "\n",
    "And:\n",
    "- $\\beta = 0$: indicates that the stock or portfolio is uncorrelated with the market.\n",
    "- $\\beta = 1$: indicates that the stock or portfolio moves in line with the market.\n",
    "- $\\beta < 1$: indicates that the stock or portfolio is less volatile than the market.\n",
    "- $\\beta > 1$: indicates that the stock or portfolio is more volatile than the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In order to calculate the beta of a portfolio, multiply the weightage of each stock in the portfolio with its beta value to arrive at the weighted average beta of the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Index Fund\n",
    "- An index fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that aims to replicate the performance of a specific index, such as the Nifty 50 or S&P 500.\n",
    "- Index funds are passively managed, meaning they do not attempt to outperform the index but rather mirror its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tracking Error\n",
    "- Tracking error is a measure of how closely a portfolio follows the index to which it is benchmarked.\n",
    "- It is the annualized standard deviation of the difference between the portfolio returns and the index returns.\n",
    "- A lower tracking error indicates that the portfolio is closely tracking the index, while a higher tracking error indicates that the portfolio is deviating from the index.\n",
    "- It is always calculated against the Total Return Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "it is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. get the NAV of the index fund and TR Index values for each day of the total time period.\n",
    "2. convert them to percentage returns.\n",
    "3. calculate the difference between the index fund returns and the TR Index returns for each day.\n",
    "4. calculate the standard deviation of the difference in returns.\n",
    "5. multiply the standard deviation by the square root of 252 (the number of trading days in a year) to annualize the tracking error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How does it arise?\n",
    "- Tracking error arises due to various factors, including:\n",
    "    1. **Management Fees**: The fees charged by the fund manager can lead to a difference in performance.\n",
    "    2. **Transaction Costs**: Buying and selling stocks incurs costs that can affect returns.\n",
    "    3. **Cash Holdings**: Index funds may hold cash for liquidity, which can lead to tracking error.\n",
    "    4. **Rebalancing**: The frequency and method of rebalancing the portfolio can also contribute to tracking error.\n"
